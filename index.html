<h1>What is PHPush?</h1>

<p>PHPush is a collection of PHP scripts which are easily modified, and meant for sending push notifications to your apps that use either Parse or Urban Airship.  In other words, they perform cURLs based on functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will continue to be expanded to allow maximum flexibility, and ease of use, and will be tightly-woven with both the <a href="https://parse.com/docs/rest">Parse REST API</a> and <a href="https://docs.urbanairship.com/display/DOCS/Server+Side">Urban Airship API</a>. They are meant to be hosted on a server or website to allow your project to POST or GET, etc. (based on the script/function) and return a JSON result.</p>

<hr><h2>More Info</h2>

<p>PHPush scripts are meant to be as easy to use and as versatile as possible, allowing you to send notifications to your app through a wide range of languages and projects.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.krio.me/how-to-send-post-request-return-contents-ruby/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html">HTML</a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://alien.dowling.edu/%7Evassil/tutorials/javapost.php">Java</a>.  Basically, if the language you are using can perform an HTTP POST request, than you can use this (soon to be) library.</p>

<p>By default, all of these scripts return a JSON response, some simple error messages, such as
    <code>{"error"="unauthorized"}</code>
Some, success messages, such as
    <code>{"result"="true"}</code></p>

<p>However, not all of the scripts/functions will return a result in this fashion.  In some cases, the JSON response is not generated by the script, it is generated by the Parse or Urban Airship servers.</p>

<p><strong>Although every script returns a JSON response, it is not necessary to use this response.</strong></p>

<p>I will expand this website more when I can, but for now, the repository is very small, and needs to be expanded.  So, until then!</p>
